Isn't it funny
how we can't see our own faces
reflections scatter before the minds eye,
lilting elusively through the willows
of the mind

At trial, we listen
to the sounds of  voices
cassetes hold sounds foreign
to our own ears

Being fourth with brightened senses,
third breakfasts,
and widened eyes.

Let more over, spill the cup
wipe our mouths
bellies up

Dwell for two nights,
shift once more
