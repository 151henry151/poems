I carry myself with ease. An adept, I am ept, kempt, and ruly.

Whilst you may disagree, I find myself gruntled, sheveled, unbothered by the troubles that weigh so many down. While others brim with pride, I am uniquely humble.

Anxious voices rise around me, their troubles appearing insurmountable, I pause, invigorated, sipid, to contemplate. Plussed, I see obstacles to conquer, problems to be solved.

Many are unchangable, convinced that to doubt their convictions would show weakness. My conviction guides me where theirs leads them astray, their steps erring, mine firm and open to challenge. There is freedom in knowing I can be reshaped, and safety in acknowledging my own vincibility.

Though the lens of self-reflection may distort, I see my mind as canny and clear, unfazed by my own contradictions.

Watch the way one carries themselves, clumsy, unwieldy, and maculate, resistant to grace, as though they fear being too careful, too clean, too deliberate.

Clarity to excess can bring blindness, if one gazes at the sun.

Am I too structured, too measured? Do not mistake my steadiness for detachment. Life is meaningful when approached with purpose.

I watch fools stumble through their own certainty and wonderâ€”does structure rob life of its beauty? In their desperation, they clutch at disorder. Have they forgotten that order, too, is a kind of freedom?
